# Top-Down-Shooter
This is a simple little javaFx game by Brey Parsons, Kwan, Alberto Zapata, Jerome Daly, Jheremi Villarrral, and Joshua Villarreal.
All it takes to run the program is hitting the play button in java.
The character moves using WASD.
SpaceBar is to shoot.
There are three rounds in total each getting a little bit more challenging.
The last level is infinite and to restart youll have to exit out of both windows and hit play again.
There is one exception that pops up when you go to a new round but it does not effect gameplay.
We hope you enjoy
